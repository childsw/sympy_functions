# sympy_functions
Lab 7 for CS256 in Fall 2024. Program for single and multi varialbe derivatives, basic-integrals, and __differential equations. 

You will need to install sympy for these functions to work

For each funciton:
  1. Import sympy as sp
  2. Define variables with sp.symbols
  3. Define a function using terms recognized by sympy
  4. Find the derivative or antiderivative with sp.diff or sp.integral
  5. Print (optionally with sp.latex for easier display dependent on platform)
